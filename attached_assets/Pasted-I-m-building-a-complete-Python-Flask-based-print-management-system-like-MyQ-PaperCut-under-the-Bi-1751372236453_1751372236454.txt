Iâ€™m building a complete Python Flask-based print management system like MyQ / PaperCut, under the Biztra brand.

Current features implemented:

âœ… LPR print job reception

âœ… Job listing and status tracking

âœ… Web upload of jobs

âœ… Print release dashboard

âœ… Raw print job storage

ðŸ“Œ I now want to expand with:

ðŸ“² Web Portal Features
Driverless print upload (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

User can see pending jobs, select printer, and release

Quota, billing, and policies per user or department

Admin dashboard for reports, quotas, pricing

Upload job â†’ release at printer or from web

ðŸ–¥ Embedded Printer Panel Features (Future Phase)
PIN or card login at printer (e.g., Kyocera panel)

View and release pending jobs from printer

"Easy Scan" button to scan to email/home folder

Scan-to-folder/email with routing logic

ðŸ’¸ Pricing, Quotas & Billing
Define price per page (mono, color, duplex)

Quota enforcement (pages/month)

Allow "bulk quota boost" for departments

Reports for usage by user/department/project

ðŸ’¡ Technologies in use:
Flask, Flask-Login, Flask-SQLAlchemy

SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod)

LPR protocol, win32print (Windows print API)

PDF tools (for preview), watchdog (for spool)

HTML/JS frontend with Bootstrap

ðŸ§© Modules in app:

routes.py â€“ All routes

lpr_server.py â€“ Accepts print jobs

monitor_print_queue.py â€“ Optional local spool watcher

models.py, utils.py, templates, static

ðŸ‘‡ What I want help with:

Modularize better (split to jobs.py, admin.py, printers.py)

Build the embedded panel module logic

Setup scan-to-email/file structure

Add upload job â†’ preview â†’ select printer â†’ release

Add quota & billing logic (in models.py and DB)

Route scanner output by user

Add pricing config UI and logic

Generate DB migration setup (Flask-Migrate)

âœ¨ Final goal:
A 100% open-source, customizable Biztra Print Manager with:

Driverless printing

Secure release from panel

Scan-to-email

Quotas, billing, analytics

Mobile/web upload and release

Please help me structure this and implement step by step.
